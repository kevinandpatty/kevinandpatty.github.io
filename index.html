					<b>Dear Friends and Family,<br /><br />

					The health and safety of our guests is still our primary concern. We regret to announce that we are cancelling our reception on May 29, 2021. Unfortunately, we will not be rescheduling.<br /><br />

					We said "I do" last October in the church of our dreams on the campus where we met. Our only wish is that we could have shared that day with all of you.<br /><br />

					We thank everyone for their understanding. Stay safe, and best wishes to you & your loved ones.<br /><br />

					Cheers,<br />
					Kevin and Patty</b>
