				<b>Welcome! We are so thrilled to celebrate our special day with each of you. The most exciting part of our wedding is having all our loved ones together. Please use this website to help plan your logistics for your time in West Lafayette. <br /><br />

				<strong>UPDATE: 8/5/20</strong><br /><br />

				Your health is our top priority! Due to COVID-19, we've decided to postpone our reception at Purdue Memorial Union's South Ballroom.<br /><br />

				We still plan to be married in a small private wedding mass on October 3, 2020. <br /><br />

				Our reception will now be held on May 29, 2021. Don't worry, even though we will technically already be husband and wife, there will still be a first dance, speeches, and all the wedding works.<br /><br />

				We thank everyone for their support and flexibility during this time.<br /><br />

				If you have any specific questions, please reach out to us directly!<br /><br />

				Love,<br />
				K & P</b>
